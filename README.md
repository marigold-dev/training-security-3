## User trust & management

- administrators : who can do what on the contract ?
- lambda / mutable code : which part of the code can change, who can do it ? Is it audited ?
- check roles : Does the user can execute this part of the code? Ex : update_operator, check if sender == owne othrwise, anyone can give permissions.
- trustable oracles : Do I trust data from this Oracle ? Is he centralized ? Who is behind it ? What is the refresh time policy ?
